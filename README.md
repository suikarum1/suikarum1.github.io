# Research Blog

This is a personal and exploratory blog focused on themes at the intersection of neuroscience, machine learning, and complex systems. It serves both as a thinking tool and as a professional portfolio, showcasing original ideas that bridge computational modeling with emerging questions in neuroscience and physics.

### Topics include:
- Mathematical biology
- Computational neuroscience
- Physics-informed models
- Cryptography and linguistics

Each post aims to explore a specific project or idea grounded in academic literature, computational methods, and experimental designs. Some are inspired by day-to-day work in machine learning infrastructure and scientific computing, while others reflect deeper inquiries into theoretical neuroscience and the nature of cognition.
