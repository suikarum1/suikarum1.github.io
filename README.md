This is a personal, exploratory blog on emergence and complexity.  
It serves as both a thinking tool and a portfolio â€” a space to journal rigorous but speculative thoughts that bridge science, math, and machine learning.

### Topics I explore include:
- Fractals, illusions, and multi-scale perception
- Consciousness, emergence, and neuroscience
- Physics-informed models
- Cryptography, compression, and representation
- Latent space geometry and signal processing

All posts aim to balance intuition and citation â€” drawing from academic papers, system design, and experimental ideas.  
Some posts are inspired by daily work in machine learning infrastructure and dynamic modeling, others by long-standing questions in philosophy of mind or symbolic systems.
